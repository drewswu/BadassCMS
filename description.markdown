### Drew's Blog

This little corner of the Interwebs just might be more Web 0.2 than 2.0... Here you'll find weird-cool shit, tech-fu, and other tales from cyberspace. The views expressed here are my own, and not my employers. ( In fact, you can safely assume that my views will be the opposite of my employers, unless they also happen to subscribe to counter-culture, intellectualist ideals :)
