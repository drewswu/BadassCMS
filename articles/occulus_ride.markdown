So I got to try out the Occulus Rift for one of the demos (Tuscany villa) as well as Team Fortress 2. My immediate impression was that it was 
really impressive, and a totally new experience, however there's a rather huge caveat which is the disorientation and the motion sickness
and what I would consider cold sweats from navigating in VR.

I think it may require slowly moving/feeling your way around the navigation system, but I just sort of came in there and started hopping around
with my FPS moves. I think once you've come down with motion sickness, there's no easy way to get out of it. I also think the keyboard buttons
for rotation are highly disorienting and this axis of moving needs some other design. I was very impressed with being able to look around and 
view the surroundings, and the 3D effect looked sort of like layers of 3D as you would see in the 3D cinema. Another thing that kept getting 
in the way is the lower resolution, which made things blurry. Forget about trying to read text.

In terms of Team Fortress 2, I tried out the demoman and found that I couldn't accurately tell how far my grenades were going, because the 
mouse controls the target reticle, and they seemed kind of weird to use in this way because of all the FPS conditioning, after all xy mouse 
axis movement would be similar to how you would use it for a web browser, not in an FPS. Needless to say, I couldn't even get a single frag. But
there was a younger dude that hopped into TF2 and started kicking ass, go figure.

In any case, I see the Occulus being really, really awesome for discover/adventure games where exploration, and walking (not running) movement 
is the main mode of gameplay. Perhaps the best franchise might be something like Silent Hill, so you can get some really horror to go with 
motion sickness >=)
