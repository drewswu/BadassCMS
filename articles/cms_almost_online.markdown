## Cms blog project almost online

This blog is my first foray into using Node.js. It's being hosted on an Amazon Free Tier instance, and it uses the wheat module, and git for maintaining the markdown files. Overall I look forward to becoming more familiar scripting with it.

I figure another week and I'll consider it ready for use by others. In the wiki I'll be adding more explicit instructions so that other people can start up there own instances, and then pull the repo, and run the install script. It should set up everything, and provide a sample template for future blog entries.

This project is hosted on [http://github.com/drewswu/BadassCMS.git](http://github.com/drewswu/BadassCMS.git)
