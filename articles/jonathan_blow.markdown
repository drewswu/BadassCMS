I guess this is one of the perks of being in "the valley". I was just plugging away at a cafe in the Mission, when I look up and who do I see? None other than Jonathan Blow of Braid and "Indie Game: The Movie" fame sitting not but two tables away from me. This is pretty amazing.

Seeing him just reminded me of why I got into computers to begin with. I mean, some engineers are in it for the money/career, some are in it to try and change the world, some are in it to solve hard problems, and others are in it because of computer games. At this point, I'd say I'm in it for a little of all of the above. Though as a kid it was computer gaming that got me into computers in general. It was the legendary RPG series by Richard Garriott aka Lord British that sealed the deal.

Braid, by Jonathan Blow, is what put "indie gaming" on the map. I've played this brilliant game and it's more than just a platformer with a catchy time-reversal mechanic. There's a lot of the creator in this game, the story attempting to capture the creator's feelings of heartbreak in a relationship.
