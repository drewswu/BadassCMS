I guess this is one of the perks of being in "The Valley". I'm just plugging away at a cafe in the Mission, when I look up and who do I see? None other than Jonathan Blow of Braid and Indie Game: The Movie fame. This is pretty amazing.

Seeing him, just reminded me of why I got into computer's to begin with: Computer games. Some engineers are in it for the money or career, some are in it to try and change the world, some are in it to solve the hardest problems, and yet others are in it because of the Golden Era of Computer Gaming (80's - 90's). I'm in it for all of the above, but what got me in it was the old Ultima series by Richard Garriott aka Lord British. This series of computer RPG's was legendary for pushing the boundaries of what an RPG could be.

Braid, by Jonathan Blow, is what put "indie gaming" on the map. I've played this masterpiece, and it's more than just a platformer with a time-reversal mechanic. There's a lot of this dude in this game, the story attempting to capture the creator's feelings of heartbreak in a relationship.

Perks of the valley...
