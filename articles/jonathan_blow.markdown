I guess this is one of the perks of being in "The Valley". I'm just plugging away at a cafe in the Mission, and I look up and who do I see? None other than Jonathan Blow of Braid and Indie Game: The Movie fame. This is pretty amazing.

Seeing him, just reminded me of why I got into computer's to begin with: Computer games.
