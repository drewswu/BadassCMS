A while back I got a chance to try out the google glass. I was immediately impressed by how fun and novel this little device was. The display was far off to the upper right periphery so it was not entirely distracting. The glasses could take photos to be uploaded to Twitter or Facebook. It could record video, and probably many more interesting things that I didn't have time to try. Overall, I felt this little device was as useful and fun as an iPad mini, not an absolute necessity, but a really cool gadget to have.

The controls are managed with a swipe motion on the glass frame. The impression I got was that the unit was well designed. I think the sky's the limit as far as it's potential uses. I don't recall whether the screen resolution would be enough for terminal use, but if it could I'd be interested in using it for remote administration of servers, hacking, and maybe light programming.

With the glasses comes the whole issue of being too connected to the Internet as well as acting as a barrier in social situations. I think constantly absorbing streams of admittedly interesting data, could detract from our attention spans and our psyches. And in social situations it just might be a little distracting, or difficult to maintain eye contact. But who knows, if it were commonplace maybe it would become more socially acceptable?

The google glass is crying out to be modded... 


I can already think of an ideal use case, add a pair of shades to the frame and bring a keyboard, and work during meetings.

I'm interested to see how people use this device, and where it goes from here.
