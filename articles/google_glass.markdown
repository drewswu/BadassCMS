A while back I got a chance to try out the google glass. My immediate impression was just how fun this little device was. The display was far off to the right, so it would not be ultimately distracting. It could take photos to be uploaded to Twitter or Facebook. It could record video, and as well probably more cool things that I didn't have time to try out.

The controls are managed with a swipe motion on the glass frame. Overall it appears to be well designed. The sky's the limit as far as it's potential uses. For me, I could see it being used for remotel administration of servers, hacking, programming, and as an integrated information device. As with all things, YMMV.

Once the device was hacked, I could see it being used for more powerful, immersive, and community-building purposes. Could this be a game changing device? Certainly. Could it be used to organize people, to bring people closer to each other? For sure.

There is a certain downside to this, the advent of more human/device interfaces. William Gibson and the whole 'cyberpunk' genre foretells of being too plugged into the Net... of course, it's all a cliche but I can see being always connected, exposed to streams of information detrimental to our attention spans and psyches.

I'm interested to see how people use this device, and where it goes from here.
