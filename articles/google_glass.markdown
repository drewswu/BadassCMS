A while back I got a chance to try out the google glass. My immediate impression was just how fun this little device was. The display was far off to the right, so it would not be ultimately distracting. It could take photos to be uploaded to Twitter or Facebook. It could record video, and as well probably do more cool things I'm not yet aware of.

The controls are managed with a swipe motion on the glass frame. Overall it appears to be well designed. The applications for its use would be many. In my particular case, I could use it to remotely administrate servers, hacking, engineering, integrated information device. Ultimately, it would probably be about as useful as an iPad mini. Your productivity might vary.

Once the device was hacked, I could see it being used for more powerful, immersive, and community-building purposes. Could this be a game changing device? Certainly. Could it be used to organize people? For sure.

There is a certain downside to this, the advent of more human/device interfaces. William Gibson and the whole 'cyberpunk' genre foretells of being too plugged into the Net. To be always connected, exposed to streams of information can be just as detrimental to our attention spans and psyches.

I'm interested to see this devices application and where it goes from here.
